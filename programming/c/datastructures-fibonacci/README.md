## Data structures and functions 

a) Write a function that takes two pointer arguments and adds 1 to the values pointed to by both pointers. The behaviour should be as follows:

```c
int a, b;
a = 10;
b = 20;
add_one_to_both(&a, &b);
// at this point a == 11 and b == 21
```

There is no skeleton code provided.


b) Create an array for storing the first 20 Fibonacci numbers, and write a `for` loop for performing the evaluation. A skeleton code is provided in file [datastructures-functions/fibonacci.c](fibonacci.c).
